In Python, it is helpful to consider what is \"built-in\" and what must be imported using an `import` statement. It is commonly accepted that Python's place in the contemporary scientific computing space is due in large part to `numpy` and its associated libraries -- the Python Numerical Stack -- all of which are not part of \"pure\" Python and must be imported. For the moment, however, let us set these aside and consider only that which is \"built-in\"."
